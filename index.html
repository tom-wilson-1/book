Against Empire is a studio journal and theoretical manuscript by Tom Wilson. The first edition (October 2025) was published by egress media (Naarm/Melbourne) and prepared in the context of RMIT BFA, Year 1—while standing as an independent work.

about the book

collects a semester-length studio journal alongside essays, dialogues, and documentation of works-in-progress and resolved pieces

organises the material across six chapters: Burden, Asymptotia, Virtue, Action, Violence, and Essays

traces practice-led research in conversation with critical theory, linking studio experiments (e.g., Thermal Poem Stack, Asymptotic Copy, agar/wax studies) to conceptual frames

engages anti-imperialism, colonialism, decolonisation, and institutional critique; invites readers to examine how power is aestheticised and to consider practical alternatives in art and everyday life
