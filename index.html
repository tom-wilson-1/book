        <em>Against Empire</em> is a studio journal and theoretical manuscript by tom wilson and others.
        The first edition (October 2025) was published by <strong>egress media</strong> (Naarm/Melbourne)
        and developed within the context of the <strong>RMIT BFA, Year 1</strong>—while standing as an
        independent work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The book collects a semester-length studio journal alongside essays, dialogues, and documentation
        of works-in-progress and resolved pieces. It organises the material across six chapters:
        <strong>Burden</strong>, <strong>Asymptotia</strong>, <strong>Virtue</strong>, <strong>Action</strong>,
        <strong>Violence</strong>, and <strong>Essays</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project traces practice-led research in conversation with critical theory, linking studio
        experiments (e.g. <em>Thermal Poem Stack</em>, <em>Asymptotic Copy</em>, <em>agar/wax studies</em>)
        to conceptual frames. It engages anti-imperialism, colonialism, decolonisation, and institutional
        critique—inviting readers to examine how power is aestheticised and to consider practical
        alternatives in art and everyday life.
