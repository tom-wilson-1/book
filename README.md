against empire

Against Empire is a studio journal and theoretical manuscript by Tom Wilson. The first edition (October 2025) was published by egress media (Naarm/Melbourne) and prepared in the context of RMIT BFA, Year 1—while standing as an independent work.

about the book
  - collects a semester-length studio journal alongside essays, dialogues, and documentation of works-in-progress and resolved pieces
  - organises the material across six chapters: Burden, Asymptotia, Virtue, Action, Violence, and Essays
  - traces practice-led research in conversation with critical theory, linking studio experiments (e.g., Thermal Poem Stack, Asymptotic Copy,     agar/wax studies) to conceptual frames
  - engages anti-imperialism, colonialism, decolonisation, and institutional critique; invites readers to examine how power is aestheticised      and to consider practical alternatives in art and everyday life
